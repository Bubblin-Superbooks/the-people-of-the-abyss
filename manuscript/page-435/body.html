<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The chief trouble with these poor folk is that they do not know how to commit suicide, and usually have to make two or three attempts before they succeed.&nbsp; This, very naturally, is a horrid nuisance to the constables and magistrates, and gives them no end of trouble.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the magistrates are frankly outspoken about the matter, and censure the prisoners for the slackness of their attempts.&nbsp; For instance Mr. R. S---, chairman of the S--- B--- magistrates, in the case the other day of Ann Wood, who tried to make away with herself in the canal: &ldquo;If you wanted to do it, why didn&rsquo;t you do it and get it done with?&rdquo; demanded the indignant Mr. R. S---.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you not get under the water and make an end of it, instead of giving us all this trouble and bother?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
