<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I stood, yesterday, in a room in one of the &ldquo;Municipal Dwellings,&rdquo; not far from Leman Street.&nbsp; If I looked into a dreary future and saw that I would have to live in such a room until I died, I should immediately go down, plump into the Thames, and cut the tenancy short.</p><p>It was not a room.&nbsp; Courtesy to the language will no more permit it to be called a room than it will permit a hovel to be called a mansion.&nbsp; It was a den, a lair.&nbsp; Seven feet by eight were its dimensions, and the ceiling was so low as not to give the cubic air space required by a British soldier in barracks.&nbsp; A crazy couch, with ragged coverlets, occupied nearly half the room.&nbsp; A rickety table, a chair, and a couple of boxes left little space in which to turn around.&nbsp; Five dollars would have purchased everything in sight.</p></div> </div>
