<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At eight-thirty, more men with tickets were admitted, and by nine the little gate was opened to us.&nbsp; We crushed through somehow, and found ourselves packed in a courtyard like sardines.&nbsp; On more occasions than one, as a Yankee tramp in Yankeeland, I have had to work for my breakfast; but for no breakfast did I ever work so hard as for this one.&nbsp; For over two hours I had waited outside, and for over another hour I waited in this packed courtyard.&nbsp; I had had nothing to eat all night, and I was weak and faint, while the smell of the soiled clothes and unwashed bodies, steaming from pent animal heat, and blocked solidly about me, nearly turned my stomach.&nbsp; So tightly were we packed, that a number of the men took advantage of the opportunity and went soundly asleep standing up.</p></div> </div>
