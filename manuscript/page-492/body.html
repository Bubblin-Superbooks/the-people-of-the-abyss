<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Not only is this beer unfit for the people to drink, but too often the men and women are unfit to drink it.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is their very unfitness that drives them to drink it.&nbsp; Ill-fed, suffering from innutrition and the evil effects of overcrowding and squalor, their constitutions develop a morbid craving for the drink, just as the sickly stomach of the overstrung Manchester factory operative hankers after excessive quantities of pickles and similar weird foods.&nbsp; Unhealthy working and living engenders unhealthy appetites and desires.&nbsp; Man cannot be worked worse than a horse is worked, and be housed and fed as a pig is housed and fed, and at the same time have clean and wholesome ideals and aspirations.</p></div> </div>
