Thou that wast his Republic, Wilt thou clasp their knees? These royalties rust-eaten, These worm-corroded lies That keep thy head storm-beaten, And sun-like strength of eyes From the open air and heaven Of intercepted skies!</p><p>SWINBURNE.</p><p>Vivat Rex Eduardus!&nbsp; They crowned a king this day, and there has been great rejoicing and elaborate tomfoolery, and I am perplexed and saddened.&nbsp; I never saw anything to compare with the pageant, except Yankee circuses and Alhambra ballets; nor did I ever see anything so hopeless and so tragic.</p></div> </div>
