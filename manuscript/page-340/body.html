<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>An analysis of one item alone will show how little room there is for waste.&nbsp; Bread, $1: for a family of five, for seven days, one dollar&rsquo;s worth of bread will give each a daily ration of 2.8 cents; and if they eat three meals a day, each may consume per meal 9.5 mills&rsquo; worth of bread, a little less than one halfpennyworth.&nbsp; Now bread is the heaviest item.&nbsp; They will get less of meat per mouth each meal, and still less of vegetates; while the smaller items become too microscopic for consideration.&nbsp; On the other hand, these food articles are all bought at small retail, the most expensive and wasteful method of purchasing.</p></div> </div>
