<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Bishop Wilkinson, who has lived in Zululand, recently said, &ldquo;No human of an African village would allow such a promiscuous mixing of young men and women, boys and girls.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had reference to the children of the overcrowded folk, who at five have nothing to learn and much to unlearn which they will never unlearn.</p><p>It is notorious that here in the Ghetto the houses of the poor are greater profit earners than the mansions of the rich.&nbsp; Not only does the poor worker have to live like a beast, but he pays proportionately more for it than does the rich man for his spacious comfort.&nbsp; A class of house-sweaters has been made possible by the competition of the poor for houses.&nbsp; There are more people than there is room, and numbers are in the workhouse because they cannot find shelter elsewhere.&nbsp; Not only are houses let, but they are sublet, and sub-sublet down to the very rooms.</p></div> </div>
