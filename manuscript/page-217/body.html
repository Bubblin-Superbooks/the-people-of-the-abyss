<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; English ships sign their sailors for the voyage, which means the round trip, sometimes lasting as long as three years; and they cannot sign off and receive their discharges until they reach the home port, which is England.&nbsp; Their wages are low, their food is bad, and their treatment worse.&nbsp; Very often they are really forced by their captains to desert in the New World or the colonies, leaving a handsome sum of wages behind them&mdash;a distinct gain, either to the captain or the owners, or to both.&nbsp; But whether for this reason alone or not, it is a fact that large numbers of them desert.&nbsp; Then, for the home voyage, the ship engages whatever sailors it can find on the beach.&nbsp; These men are engaged at the somewhat higher wages that obtain in other portions of the world, under the agreement that they shall sign off on reaching England.</p></div> </div>
