<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; No matter how you starve and suffer here, you will feast in Paradise, that is, if you will follow the directions.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so forth and so forth.&nbsp; A clever bit of propaganda, I took it, but rendered of no avail for two reasons.&nbsp; First, the men who received it were unimaginative and materialistic, unaware of the existence of any Unseen, and too inured to hell on earth to be frightened by hell to come.&nbsp; And second, weary and exhausted from the night&rsquo;s sleeplessness and hardship, suffering from the long wait upon their feet, and faint from hunger, they were yearning, not for salvation, but for grub.&nbsp; The &ldquo;soul-snatchers&rdquo; (as these men call all religious propagandists), should study the physiological basis of psychology a little, if they wish to make their efforts more effective.</p></div> </div>
