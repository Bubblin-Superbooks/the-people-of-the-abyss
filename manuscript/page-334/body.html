<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was a stationary crank in the yard, let into the ground; the hole was 18 inches long, 15 inches deep, and 15 inches wide.&nbsp; The crank revolved in the hole three revolutions a minute.&nbsp; There was no fence or covering over the hole.&nbsp; Since my accident they have stopped it altogether, and have covered the hole up with a piece of sheet iron. . . . They gave me &pound;25.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t reckon that as compensation; they said it was only for charity&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Out of that I paid &pound;9 for a machine by which to wheel myself about.</p><p>I was labouring at the time I got my legs off.&nbsp; I got twenty-four shillings a week, rather better pay than the other men, because I used to take shifts.&nbsp; When there was heavy work to be done I used to be picked out to do it.</p></div> </div>
