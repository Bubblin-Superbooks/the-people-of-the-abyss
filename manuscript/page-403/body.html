<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The &ldquo;cabins&rdquo; were the best accommodation, each cabin allowing space for a tiny bed and room alongside of it in which to undress.&nbsp; The bedding was clean, and with neither it nor the bed do I find any fault.&nbsp; But there was no privacy about it, no being alone.</p><p>To get an adequate idea of a floor filled with cabins, you have merely to magnify a layer of the pasteboard pigeon-holes of an egg-crate till each pigeon-hole is seven feet in height and otherwise properly dimensioned, then place the magnified layer on the floor of a large, barnlike room, and there you have it.&nbsp; There are no ceilings to the pigeon-holes, the walls are thin, and the snores from all the sleepers and every move and turn of your nearer neighbours come plainly to your ears.&nbsp; And this cabin is yours only for a little while.&nbsp; In the morning out you go.</p></div> </div>
