<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Drunken women fighting!&nbsp; It is not nice to think of; it is far worse to listen to.&nbsp; Something like this it runs&mdash;</p><p>Incoherent babble, shrieked at the top of the lungs of several women; a lull, in which is heard a child crying and a young girl&rsquo;s voice pleading tearfully; a woman&rsquo;s voice rises, harsh and grating, &ldquo;You &rsquo;it me!&nbsp; Jest you &rsquo;it me!&rdquo; then, swat! challenge accepted and fight rages afresh.</p><p>The back windows of the houses commanding the scene are lined with enthusiastic spectators, and the sound of blows, and of oaths that make one&rsquo;s blood run cold, are borne to my ears.&nbsp; Happily, I cannot see the combatants.</p></div> </div>
