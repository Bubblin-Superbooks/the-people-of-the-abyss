<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now such a room as I have described is not home but horror; and the men and women who flee away from it to the public-house are to be pitied, not blamed.&nbsp; There are 300,000 people, in London, divided into families that live in single rooms, while there are 900,000 who are illegally housed according to the Public Health Act of 1891&mdash;a respectable recruiting-ground for the drink traffic.</p><p>Then there are the insecurity of happiness, the precariousness of existence, the well-founded fear of the future&mdash;potent factors in driving people to drink.&nbsp; Wretchedness squirms for alleviation, and in the public-house its pain is eased and forgetfulness is obtained.&nbsp; It is unhealthy.&nbsp; Certainly it is, but everything else about their lives is unhealthy, while this brings the oblivion that nothing else in their lives can bring.</p></div> </div>
