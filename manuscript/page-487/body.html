<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Day of Judgment!&nbsp; More than he want it.&nbsp; From all the land rises the hunger wail, from Ghetto and countryside, from prison and casual ward, from asylum and workhouse&mdash;the cry of the people who have not enough to eat.&nbsp; Millions of people, men, women, children, little babes, the blind, the deaf, the halt, the sick, vagabonds and toilers, prisoners and paupers, the people of Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, who have not enough to eat.&nbsp; And this, in face of the fact that five men can produce bread for a thousand; that one workman can produce cotton cloth for 250 people, woollens for 300, and boots and shoes for 1000.&nbsp; It would seem that 40,000,000 people are keeping a big house, and that they are keeping it badly.&nbsp; The income is all right, but there is something criminally wrong with the management.</p></div> </div>
