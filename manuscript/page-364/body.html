<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A part of a room to let.&rdquo;&nbsp; This notice was posted a short while ago in a window not five minutes&rsquo; walk from St. James&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; The Rev. Hugh Price Hughes is authority for the statement that beds are let on the three-relay system&mdash;that is, three tenants to a bed, each occupying it eight hours, so that it never grows cold; while the floor space underneath the bed is likewise let on the three-relay system.&nbsp; Health officers are not at all unused to finding such cases as the following: in one room having a cubic capacity of 1000 feet, three adult females in the bed, and two adult females under the bed; and in one room of 1650 cubic feet, one adult male and two children in the bed, and two adult females under the bed.</p></div> </div>
