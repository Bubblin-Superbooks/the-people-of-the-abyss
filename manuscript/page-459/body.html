<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Rev. J. Cartmel Robinson tells of a boy and girl of his parish who set out to walk to the forest.&nbsp; They walked and walked through the never-ending streets, expecting always to see it by-and-by; until they sat down at last, faint and despairing, and were rescued by a kind woman who brought them back.&nbsp; Evidently they had been overlooked by the people who try to help.</p><p>The same gentleman is authority for the statement that in a street in Hoxton (a district of the vast East End), over seven hundred children, between five and thirteen years, live in eighty small houses.&nbsp; And he adds: &ldquo;It is because London has largely shut her children in a maze of streets and houses and robbed them of their rightful inheritance in sky and field and brook, that they grow up to be men and women physically unfit.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
