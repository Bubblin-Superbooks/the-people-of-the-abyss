<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The tide is out,&rdquo; called a gypsy-looking woman to her mates, as we came up a long row of bins into which the pickers were stripping the hops.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you twig?&rdquo; Bert whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s on to you.&rdquo;</p><p>I twigged.&nbsp; And it must be confessed the figure was an apt one.&nbsp; When the tide is out boats are left on the beach and do not sail, and a sailor, when the tide is out, does not sail either.&nbsp; My seafaring togs and my presence in the hop field proclaimed that I was a seaman without a ship, a man on the beach, and very like a craft at low water.</p></div> </div>
