<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As home-life vanishes, the public-house appears.&nbsp; Not only do men and women abnormally crave drink, who are overworked, exhausted, suffering from deranged stomachs and bad sanitation, and deadened by the ugliness and monotony of existence, but the gregarious men and women who have no home-life flee to the bright and clattering public-house in a vain attempt to express their gregariousness.&nbsp; And when a family is housed in one small room, home-life is impossible.</p><p>A brief examination of such a dwelling will serve to bring to light one important cause of drunkenness.&nbsp; Here the family arises in the morning, dresses, and makes its toilet, father, mother, sons, and daughters, and in the same room, shoulder to shoulder (for the room is small), the wife and mother cooks the breakfast.</p></div> </div>
