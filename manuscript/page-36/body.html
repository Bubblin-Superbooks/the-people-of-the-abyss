<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In my rags and tatters I escaped the pestilence of tipping, and encountered men on a basis of equality.&nbsp; Nay, before the day was out I turned the tables, and said, most gratefully, &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; to a gentleman whose horse I held, and who dropped a penny into my eager palm.</p><p>Other changes I discovered were wrought in my condition by my new garb.&nbsp; In crossing crowded thoroughfares I found I had to be, if anything, more lively in avoiding vehicles, and it was strikingly impressed upon me that my life had cheapened in direct ratio with my clothes.&nbsp; When before I inquired the way of a policeman, I was usually asked, &ldquo;Bus or &rsquo;ansom, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; But now the query became, &ldquo;Walk or ride?&rdquo;&nbsp; Also, at the railway stations, a third-class ticket was now shoved out to me as a matter of course.</p></div> </div>
