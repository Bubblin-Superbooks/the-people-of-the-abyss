<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As an illustration of how a good worker may suddenly become inefficient, and what then happens to him, I am tempted to give the case of M&rsquo;Garry, a man thirty-two years of age, and an inmate of the workhouse.&nbsp; The extracts are quoted from the annual report of the trade union.</p><p>I worked at Sullivan&rsquo;s place in Widnes, better known as the British Alkali Chemical Works.&nbsp; I was working in a shed, and I had to cross the yard.&nbsp; It was ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and there was no light about.&nbsp; While crossing the yard I felt something take hold of my leg and screw it off.&nbsp; I became unconscious; I didn&rsquo;t know what became of me for a day or two.&nbsp; On the following Sunday night I came to my senses, and found myself in the hospital.&nbsp; I asked the nurse what was to do with my legs, and she told me both legs were off.</p></div> </div>
