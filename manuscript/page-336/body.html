<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It must be understood that efficiency is not determined by the workers themselves, but is determined by the demand for labour.&nbsp; If three men seek one position, the most efficient man will get it.&nbsp; The other two, no matter how capable they may be, will none the less be inefficients.&nbsp; If Germany, Japan, and the United States should capture the entire world market for iron, coal, and textiles, at once the English workers would be thrown idle by hundreds of thousands.&nbsp; Some would emigrate, but the rest would rush their labour into the remaining industries.&nbsp; A general shaking up of the workers from top to bottom would result; and when equilibrium had been restored, the number of the inefficients at the bottom of the Abyss would have been increased by hundreds of thousands.</p></div> </div>
