<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In one place a family group, a child asleep in its sleeping mother&rsquo;s arms, and the husband (or male mate) clumsily mending a dilapidated shoe.&nbsp; On another bench a woman trimming the frayed strips of her rags with a knife, and another woman, with thread and needle, sewing up rents.&nbsp; Adjoining, a man holding a sleeping woman in his arms.&nbsp; Farther on, a man, his clothing caked with gutter mud, asleep, with head in the lap of a woman, not more than twenty-five years old, and also asleep.</p><p>It was this sleeping that puzzled me.&nbsp; Why were nine out of ten of them asleep or trying to sleep?&nbsp; But it was not till afterwards that I learned.&nbsp; It is a law of the powers that be that the homeless shall not sleep by night.</p></div> </div>
