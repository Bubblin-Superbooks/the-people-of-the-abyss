<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>No more dreary spectacle can be found on this earth than the whole of the &ldquo;awful East,&rdquo; with its Whitechapel, Hoxton, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green, and Wapping to the East India Docks.&nbsp; The colour of life is grey and drab.&nbsp; Everything is helpless, hopeless, unrelieved, and dirty.&nbsp; Bath tubs are a thing totally unknown, as mythical as the ambrosia of the gods.&nbsp; The people themselves are dirty, while any attempt at cleanliness becomes howling farce, when it is not pitiful and tragic.&nbsp; Strange, vagrant odours come drifting along the greasy wind, and the rain, when it falls, is more like grease than water from heaven.&nbsp; The very cobblestones are scummed with grease.</p><p>Here lives a population as dull and unimaginative as its long grey miles of dingy brick.</p></div> </div>
