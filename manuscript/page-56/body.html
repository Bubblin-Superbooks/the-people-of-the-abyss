<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is only a question of months when Johnny Upright&rsquo;s street must go.&nbsp; He realises it himself.</p><p>&ldquo;In a couple of years,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;my lease expires.&nbsp; My landlord is one of our kind.&nbsp; He has not put up the rent on any of his houses here, and this has enabled us to stay.&nbsp; But any day he may sell, or any day he may die, which is the same thing so far as we are concerned.&nbsp; The house is bought by a money breeder, who builds a sweat shop on the patch of ground at the rear where my grapevine is, adds to the house, and rents it a room to a family.&nbsp; There you are, and Johnny Upright&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
