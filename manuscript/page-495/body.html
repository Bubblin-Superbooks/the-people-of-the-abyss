<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; When a child dies, and some are always bound to die, since fifty-five per cent. of the East End children die before they are five years old, the body is laid out in the same room.&nbsp; And if they are very poor, it is kept for some time until they can bury it.&nbsp; During the day it lies on the bed; during the night, when the living take the bed, the dead occupies the table, from which, in the morning, when the dead is put back into the bed, they eat their breakfast.&nbsp; Sometimes the body is placed on the shelf which serves as a pantry for their food.&nbsp; Only a couple of weeks ago, an East End woman was in trouble, because, in this fashion, being unable to bury it, she had kept her dead child three weeks.</p></div> </div>
