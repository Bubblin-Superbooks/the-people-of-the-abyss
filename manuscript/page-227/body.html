<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All in good time, about eleven o&rsquo;clock, breakfast arrived.&nbsp; It arrived, not on plates, but in paper parcels.&nbsp; I did not have all I wanted, and I am sure that no man there had all he wanted, or half of what he wanted or needed.&nbsp; I gave part of my bread to the tramp royal who was waiting for Buffalo Bill, and he was as ravenous at the end as he was in the beginning.&nbsp; This is the breakfast: two slices of bread, one small piece of bread with raisins in it and called &ldquo;cake,&rdquo; a wafer of cheese, and a mug of &ldquo;water bewitched.&rdquo;&nbsp; Numbers of the men had been waiting since five o&rsquo;clock for it, while all of us had waited at least four hours; and in addition, we had been herded like swine, packed like sardines, and treated like curs, and been preached at, and sung to, and prayed for.&nbsp; Nor was that all.</p></div> </div>
