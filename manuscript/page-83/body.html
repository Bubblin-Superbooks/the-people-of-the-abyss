<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The Abyss seems to exude a stupefying atmosphere of torpor, which wraps about them and deadens them.&nbsp; Religion passes them by.&nbsp; The Unseen holds for them neither terror nor delight.&nbsp; They are unaware of the Unseen; and the full belly and the evening pipe, with their regular &ldquo;arf an&rsquo; arf,&rdquo; is all they demand, or dream of demanding, from existence.</p><p>This would not be so bad if it were all; but it is not all.&nbsp; The satisfied torpor in which they are sunk is the deadly inertia that precedes dissolution.&nbsp; There is no progress, and with them not to progress is to fall back and into the Abyss.&nbsp; In their own lives they may only start to fall, leaving the fall to be completed by their children and their children&rsquo;s children.</p></div> </div>
