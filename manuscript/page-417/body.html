Forwood calculates that&mdash;</p><p>1 of every 1400 workmen is killed annually. 1 of every 2500 workmen is totally disabled. 1 of every 300 workmen is permanently partially disabled. 1 of every 8 workmen is temporarily disabled 3 or 4 weeks.</p><p>But these are only the accidents of industry.&nbsp; The high mortality of the people who live in the Ghetto plays a terrible part.&nbsp; The average age at death among the people of the West End is fifty-five years; the average age at death among the people of the East End is thirty years.&nbsp; That is to say, the person in the West End has twice the chance for life that the person has in the East End.&nbsp; Talk of war!&nbsp; The mortality in South Africa and the Philippines fades away to insignificance.</p></div> </div>
