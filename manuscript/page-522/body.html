<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is a greater army &nbsp;&nbsp; That besets us round with strife, A starving, numberless army &nbsp;&nbsp; At all the gates of life.</p><p>The poverty-stricken millions &nbsp;&nbsp; Who challenge our wine and bread, And impeach us all as traitors, &nbsp;&nbsp; Both the living and the dead.</p><p>And whenever I sit at the banquet, &nbsp;&nbsp; Where the feast and song are high, Amid the mirth and music &nbsp;&nbsp; I can hear that fearful cry.</p><p>And hollow and haggard faces &nbsp;&nbsp; Look into the lighted hall, And wasted hands are extended &nbsp;&nbsp; To catch the crumbs that fall</p></div> </div>
