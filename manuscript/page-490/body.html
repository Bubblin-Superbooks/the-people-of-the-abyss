<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The English working classes may be said to be soaked in beer.&nbsp; They are made dull and sodden by it.&nbsp; Their efficiency is sadly impaired, and they lose whatever imagination, invention, and quickness may be theirs by right of race.&nbsp; It may hardly be called an acquired habit, for they are accustomed to it from their earliest infancy.&nbsp; Children are begotten in drunkenness, saturated in drink before they draw their first breath, born to the smell and taste of it, and brought up in the midst of it.</p><p>The public-house is ubiquitous.&nbsp; It flourishes on every corner and between corners, and it is frequented almost as much by women as by men.&nbsp; Children are to be found in it as well, waiting till their fathers and mothers are ready to go home, sipping from the glasses of their elders, listening to the coarse language and degrading conversation, catching the contagion of it, familiarising themselves with licentiousness and debauchery.</p></div> </div>
