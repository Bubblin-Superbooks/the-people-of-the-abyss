<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A new race has sprung up, a street people.&nbsp; They pass their lives at work and in the streets.&nbsp; They have dens and lairs into which to crawl for sleeping purposes, and that is all.&nbsp; One cannot travesty the word by calling such dens and lairs &ldquo;homes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The traditional silent and reserved Englishman has passed away.&nbsp; The pavement folk are noisy, voluble, high-strung, excitable&mdash;when they are yet young.&nbsp; As they grow older they become steeped and stupefied in beer.&nbsp; When they have nothing else to do, they ruminate as a cow ruminates.&nbsp; They are to be met with everywhere, standing on curbs and corners, and staring into vacancy.&nbsp; Watch one of them.&nbsp; He will stand there, motionless, for hours, and when you go away you will leave him still staring into vacancy.&nbsp; It is most absorbing.</p></div> </div>
