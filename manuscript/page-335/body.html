<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Mr. Manton, the manager, visited me at the hospital several times.&nbsp; When I was getting better, I asked him if he would be able to find me a job.&nbsp; He told me not to trouble myself, as the firm was not cold-hearted.&nbsp; I would be right enough in any case . . . Mr. Manton stopped coming to see me; and the last time, he said he thought of asking the directors to give me a fifty-pound note, so I could go home to my friends in Ireland.</p><p>Poor M&rsquo;Garry!&nbsp; He received rather better pay than the other men because he was ambitious and took shifts, and when heavy work was to be done he was the man picked out to do it.&nbsp; And then the thing happened, and he went into the workhouse.&nbsp; The alternative to the workhouse is to go home to Ireland and burden his friends for the rest of his life.&nbsp; Comment is superfluous.</p></div> </div>
