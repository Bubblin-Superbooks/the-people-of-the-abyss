<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There are 300,000 people in London, divided into families, that live in one-room tenements.&nbsp; Far, far more live in two and three rooms and are as badly crowded, regardless of sex, as those that live in one room.&nbsp; The law demands 400 cubic feet of space for each person.&nbsp; In army barracks each soldier is allowed 600 cubic feet.&nbsp; Professor Huxley, at one time himself a medical officer in East London, always held that each person should have 800 cubic feet of space, and that it should be well ventilated with pure air.&nbsp; Yet in London there are 900,000 people living in less than the 400 cubic feet prescribed by the law.</p><p>Mr. Charles Booth, who engaged in a systematic work of years in charting and classifying the toiling city population, estimates that there are 1,800,000 people in London who are poor and very poor.</p></div> </div>
