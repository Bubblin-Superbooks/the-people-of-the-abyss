<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Concerning the futility of the people who try to help, I wish to make one notable, noble exception, namely, the Dr. Barnardo Homes.&nbsp; Dr. Barnardo is a child-catcher.&nbsp; First, he catches them when they are young, before they are set, hardened, in the vicious social mould; and then he sends them away to grow up and be formed in another and better social mould.&nbsp; Up to date he has sent out of the country 13,340 boys, most of them to Canada, and not one in fifty has failed.&nbsp; A splendid record, when it is considered that these lads are waifs and strays, homeless and parentless, jerked out from the very bottom of the Abyss, and forty-nine out of fifty of them made into men.</p></div> </div>
