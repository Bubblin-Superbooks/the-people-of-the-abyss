<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Shades of Old Sleuth and Sherlock Holmes!&nbsp; I wondered as to where the assistant was located whose duty it was to take down whatever information I might loudly vouchsafe.&nbsp; And to this day, much as I have seen of Johnny Upright and much as I have puzzled over the incident, I have never been quite able to make up my mind as to whether or not he had a cold, or had an assistant planted in the other room.&nbsp; But of one thing I am sure: though I gave Johnny Upright the facts concerning myself and project, he withheld judgment till next day, when I dodged into his street conventionally garbed and in a hansom.&nbsp; Then his greeting was cordial enough, and I went down into the dining-room to join the family at tea.</p></div> </div>
