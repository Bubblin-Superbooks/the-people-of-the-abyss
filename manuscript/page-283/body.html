<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Slum, stews, and ghetto pour them forth, and the festering contents of slum, stews, and ghetto are undiminished.&nbsp; Yet they overrun the country like an army of ghouls, and the country does not want them.&nbsp; They are out of place.&nbsp; As they drag their squat, misshapen bodies along the highways and byways, they resemble some vile spawn from underground.&nbsp; Their very presence, the fact of their existence, is an outrage to the fresh, bright sun and the green and growing things.&nbsp; The clean, upstanding trees cry shame upon them and their withered crookedness, and their rottenness is a slimy desecration of the sweetness and purity of nature.</p><p>Is the picture overdrawn?&nbsp; It all depends.&nbsp; For one who sees and thinks life in terms of shares and coupons, it is certainly overdrawn.&nbsp; But for one who sees and thinks life in terms of manhood and womanhood, it cannot be overdrawn.</p></div> </div>
