<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; East London is such a ghetto, where the rich and the powerful do not dwell, and the traveller cometh not, and where two million workers swarm, procreate, and die.</p><p>It must not be supposed that all the workers of London are crowded into the East End, but the tide is setting strongly in that direction.&nbsp; The poor quarters of the city proper are constantly being destroyed, and the main stream of the unhoused is toward the east.&nbsp; In the last twelve years, one district, &ldquo;London over the Border,&rdquo; as it is called, which lies well beyond Aldgate, Whitechapel, and Mile End, has increased 260,000, or over sixty per cent.&nbsp; The churches in this district, by the way, can seat but one in every thirty-seven of the added population.</p></div> </div>
