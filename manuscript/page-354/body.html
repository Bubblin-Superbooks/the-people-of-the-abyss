<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The City of Dreadful Monotony, the East End is often called, especially by well-fed, optimistic sightseers, who look over the surface of things and are merely shocked by the intolerable sameness and meanness of it all.&nbsp; If the East End is worthy of no worse title than The City of Dreadful Monotony, and if working people are unworthy of variety and beauty and surprise, it would not be such a bad place in which to live.&nbsp; But the East End does merit a worse title.&nbsp; It should be called The City of Degradation.</p><p>While it is not a city of slums, as some people imagine, it may well be said to be one gigantic slum.&nbsp; From the standpoint of simple decency and clean manhood and womanhood, any mean street, of all its mean streets, is a slum.</p></div> </div>
