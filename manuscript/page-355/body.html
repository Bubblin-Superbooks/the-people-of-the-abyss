<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Where sights and sounds abound which neither you nor I would care to have our children see and hear is a place where no man&rsquo;s children should live, and see, and hear.&nbsp; Where you and I would not care to have our wives pass their lives is a place where no other man&rsquo;s wife should have to pass her life.&nbsp; For here, in the East End, the obscenities and brute vulgarities of life are rampant.&nbsp; There is no privacy.&nbsp; The bad corrupts the good, and all fester together.&nbsp; Innocent childhood is sweet and beautiful: but in East London innocence is a fleeting thing, and you must catch them before they crawl out of the cradle, or you will find the very babes as unholily wise as you.</p></div> </div>
