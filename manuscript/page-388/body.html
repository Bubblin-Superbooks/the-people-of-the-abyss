<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is a comparison which sailormen make between the English and American merchant services.&nbsp; In an English ship, they say, it is poor grub, poor pay, and easy work; in an American ship, good grub, good pay, and hard work.&nbsp; And this is applicable to the working populations of both countries.&nbsp; The ocean greyhounds have to pay for speed and steam, and so does the workman.&nbsp; But if the workman is not able to pay for it, he will not have the speed and steam, that is all.&nbsp; The proof of it is when the English workman comes to America.&nbsp; He will lay more bricks in New York than he will in London, still more bricks in St. Louis, and still more bricks when he gets to San Francisco.</p></div> </div>
