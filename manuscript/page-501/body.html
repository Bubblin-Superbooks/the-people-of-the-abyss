<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Of what use, in the name of God, is it to establish nurseries for women workers, in which, for instance, a child is taken while the mother makes violets in Islington at three farthings a gross, when more children and violet-makers than they can cope with are being born right along?&nbsp; This violet-maker handles each flower four times, 576 handlings for three farthings, and in the day she handles the flowers 6912 times for a wage of ninepence.&nbsp; She is being robbed.&nbsp; Somebody is on her back, and a yearning for the Beautiful and True and Good will not lighten her burden.&nbsp; They do nothing for her, these dabblers; and what they do not do for the mother, undoes at night, when the child comes home, all that they have done for the child in the day.</p></div> </div>
