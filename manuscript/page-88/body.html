<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I talked with a woman who was representative of that type which has been jerked out of its little out-of-the-way streets and has started on the fatal fall to the bottom.&nbsp; Her husband was a fitter and a member of the Engineers&rsquo; Union.&nbsp; That he was a poor engineer was evidenced by his inability to get regular employment.&nbsp; He did not have the energy and enterprise necessary to obtain or hold a steady position.</p><p>The pair had two daughters, and the four of them lived in a couple of holes, called &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; by courtesy, for which they paid seven shillings per week.&nbsp; They possessed no stove, managing their cooking on a single gas-ring in the fireplace.&nbsp; Not being persons of property, they were unable to obtain an unlimited supply of gas; but a clever machine had been installed for their benefit.</p></div> </div>
