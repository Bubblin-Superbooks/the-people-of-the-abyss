<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Here were two large and gloomily lighted rooms, in which men cooked and ate.&nbsp; I had intended to do some cooking myself, but the smell of the place stole away my appetite, or, rather, wrested it from me; so I contented myself with watching other men cook and eat.</p><p>One workman, home from work, sat down opposite me at the rough wooden table, and began his meal.&nbsp; A handful of salt on the not over-clean table constituted his butter.&nbsp; Into it he dipped his bread, mouthful by mouthful, and washed it down with tea from a big mug.&nbsp; A piece of fish completed his bill of fare.&nbsp; He ate silently, looking neither to right nor left nor across at me.&nbsp; Here and there, at the various tables, other men were eating, just as silently.&nbsp; In the whole room there was hardly a note of conversation.&nbsp; A feeling of gloom pervaded the ill-lighted place.</p></div> </div>
