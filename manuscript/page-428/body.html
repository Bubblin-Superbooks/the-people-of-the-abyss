<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To the young working-man or working-woman, or married couple, there is no assurance of happy or healthy middle life, nor of solvent old age.&nbsp; Work as they will, they cannot make their future secure.&nbsp; It is all a matter of chance.&nbsp; Everything depends upon the thing happening, the thing with which they have nothing to do.&nbsp; Precaution cannot fend it off, nor can wiles evade it.&nbsp; If they remain on the industrial battlefield they must face it and take their chance against heavy odds.&nbsp; Of course, if they are favourably made and are not tied by kinship duties, they may run away from the industrial battlefield.&nbsp; In which event the safest thing the man can do is to join the army; and for the woman, possibly, to become a Red Cross nurse or go into a nunnery.&nbsp; In either case they must forego home and children and all that makes life worth living and old age other than a nightmare.</p></div> </div>
