<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; But with the sweat-shops, married women who eke out their husband&rsquo;s earnings, and single women who have but themselves miserably to support, determine the scale of wages.&nbsp; And this scale of wages, so determined, is so low that the mother and her three children can live only in positive beastliness and semi-starvation, till decay and death end their suffering.</p><p>To show that this mother, with her three children to support, cannot compete in the sweating industries, I instance from the current newspapers the two following cases:-</p><p>A father indignantly writes that his daughter and a girl companion receive 8.5d. per gross for making boxes.&nbsp; They made each day four gross.&nbsp; Their expenses were 8d. for car fare, 2d. for stamps, 2.5d. for glue, and 1d. for string, so that all they earned between them was 1s. 9d., or a daily wage each of 10.5d.</p></div> </div>
