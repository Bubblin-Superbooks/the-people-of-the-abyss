<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; And when this state of affairs is looked at in its larger aspect, the same will be found true of hundreds of thousands and even millions of men and women living amicably together and co-operating in the pursuit of food and shelter.</p><p>The figures are appalling: 1,800,000 people in London live on the poverty line and below it, and 1,000,000 live with one week&rsquo;s wages between them and pauperism.&nbsp; In all England and Wales, eighteen per cent. of the whole population are driven to the parish for relief, and in London, according to the statistics of the London County Council, twenty-one per cent. of the whole population are driven to the parish for relief.&nbsp; Between being driven to the parish for relief and being an out-and-out pauper there is a great difference, yet London supports 123,000 paupers, quite a city of folk in themselves.</p></div> </div>
