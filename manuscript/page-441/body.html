<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A decent-looking young woman, named Ellen Gray, was remanded on a charge of attempting to commit suicide.&nbsp; About half-past eight on Sunday morning Constable 834 K found defendant lying in a doorway in Benworth Street, and she was in a very drowsy condition.&nbsp; She was holding an empty bottle in one hand, and stated that some two or three hours previously she had swallowed a quantity of laudanum.&nbsp; As she was evidently very ill, the divisional surgeon was sent for, and having administered some coffee, ordered that she was to be kept awake.&nbsp; When defendant was charged, she stated that the reason why she attempted to take her life was she had neither home nor friends.</p><p>I do not say that all people who commit suicide are sane, no more than I say that all people who do not commit suicide are sane.</p></div> </div>
