<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Oscar Wilde, God rest his soul, voices the cry of the prison child, which, in varying degree, is the cry of the prison man and woman:-</p><p>&ldquo;The second thing from which a child suffers in prison is hunger.&nbsp; The food that is given to it consists of a piece of usually bad-baked prison bread and a tin of water for breakfast at half-past seven.&nbsp; At twelve o&rsquo;clock it gets dinner, composed of a tin of coarse Indian meal stirabout (skilly), and at half-past five it gets a piece of dry bread and a tin of water for its supper.&nbsp; This diet in the case of a strong grown man is always productive of illness of some kind, chiefly of course diarrhoea, with its attendant weakness.&nbsp; In fact, in a big prison astringent medicines are served out regularly by the warders as a matter of course.&nbsp; In the case of a child, the child is, as a rule, incapable of eating the food at all.</p></div> </div>
