<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Times have changed, alas!&nbsp; When I was a youngster I used to read of homeless boys sleeping in doorways.&nbsp; Already the thing has become a tradition.&nbsp; As a stock situation it will doubtless linger in literature for a century to come, but as a cold fact it has ceased to be.&nbsp; Here are the doorways, and here are the boys, but happy conjunctions are no longer effected.&nbsp; The doorways remain empty, and the boys keep awake and carry the banner.</p><p>&ldquo;I was down under the arches,&rdquo; grumbled another young fellow.&nbsp; By &ldquo;arches&rdquo; he meant the shore arches where begin the bridges that span the Thames.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was down under the arches wen it was ryning its &rsquo;ardest, an&rsquo; a bobby comes in an&rsquo; chyses me out.&nbsp; But I come back, an&rsquo; &rsquo;e come too.</p></div> </div>
