<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There are 40,000,000 of the English folk, and 939 out of every 1000 of them die in poverty, while a constant army of 8,000,000 struggles on the ragged edge of starvation.&nbsp; Further, each babe that is born, is born in debt to the sum of &pound;22.&nbsp; This is because of an artifice called the National Debt.</p><p>In a fair comparison of the average Innuit and the average Englishman, it will be seen that life is less rigorous for the Innuit; that while the Innuit suffers only during bad times from starvation, the Englishman suffers during good times as well; that no Innuit lacks fuel, clothing, or housing, while the Englishman is in perpetual lack of these three essentials.&nbsp; In this connection it is well to instance the judgment of a man such as Huxley.</p></div> </div>
