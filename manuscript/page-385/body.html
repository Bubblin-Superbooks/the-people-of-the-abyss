<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And what is true of the coffee is true of the coffee-house.&nbsp; Working-men, in the main, frequent these places, and greasy, dirty places they are, without one thing about them to cherish decency in a man or put self-respect into him.&nbsp; Table-cloths and napkins are unknown.&nbsp; A man eats in the midst of the d&eacute;bris left by his predecessor, and dribbles his own scraps about him and on the floor.&nbsp; In rush times, in such places, I have positively waded through the muck and mess that covered the floor, and I have managed to eat because I was abominably hungry and capable of eating anything.</p><p>This seems to be the normal condition of the working-man, from the zest with which he addresses himself to the board.&nbsp; Eating is a necessity, and there are no frills about it.</p></div> </div>
