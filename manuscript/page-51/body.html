<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My first discovery was that empty houses were few and far between&mdash;so far between, in fact, that though I walked miles in irregular circles over a large area, I still remained between.&nbsp; Not one empty house could I find&mdash;a conclusive proof that the district was &ldquo;saturated.&rdquo;</p><p>It being plain that as a poor young man with a family I could rent no houses at all in this most undesirable region, I next looked for rooms, unfurnished rooms, in which I could store my wife and babies and chattels.&nbsp; There were not many, but I found them, usually in the singular, for one appears to be considered sufficient for a poor man&rsquo;s family in which to cook and eat and sleep.&nbsp; When I asked for two rooms, the sublettees looked at me very much in the manner, I imagine, that a certain personage looked at Oliver Twist when he asked for more.</p></div> </div>
