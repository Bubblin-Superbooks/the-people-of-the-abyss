<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>These two men, turned away from the casual ward of Whitechapel Workhouse, were bound with me for Poplar Workhouse.&nbsp; Not much of a show, they thought, but to chance it was all that remained to us.&nbsp; It was Poplar, or the streets and night.&nbsp; Both men were anxious for a bed, for they were &ldquo;about gone,&rdquo; as they phrased it.&nbsp; The Carter, fifty-eight years of age, had spent the last three nights without shelter or sleep, while the Carpenter, sixty-five years of age, had been out five nights.</p><p>But, O dear, soft people, full of meat and blood, with white beds and airy rooms waiting you each night, how can I make you know what it is to suffer as you would suffer if you spent a weary night on London&rsquo;s streets!&nbsp; Believe me, you would think a thousand centuries had come and gone before the east paled into dawn;</p></div> </div>
