<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After a shave and a bath, with my clothes all off, I got in between clean white sheets and went to sleep.&nbsp; It was six in the evening when I closed my eyes.&nbsp; When they opened again, the clocks were striking nine next morning.&nbsp; I had slept fifteen straight hours.&nbsp; And as I lay there drowsily, my mind went back to the seven hundred unfortunates I had left waiting for services.&nbsp; No bath, no shave for them, no clean white sheets and all clothes off, and fifteen hours&rsquo; straight sleep.&nbsp; Services over, it was the weary streets again, the problem of a crust of bread ere night, and the long sleepless night in the streets, and the pondering of the problem of how to obtain a crust at dawn.</p></div> </div>
