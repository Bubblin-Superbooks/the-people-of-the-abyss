<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And truly I saw Johnny Upright, and his good wife and fair daughters, and frowzy slavey, like so many ghosts flitting eastward through the gloom, the monster city roaring at their heels.</p><p>But Johnny Upright is not alone in his flitting.&nbsp; Far, far out, on the fringe of the city, live the small business men, little managers, and successful clerks.&nbsp; They dwell in cottages and semi-detached villas, with bits of flower garden, and elbow room, and breathing space.&nbsp; They inflate themselves with pride, and throw out their chests when they contemplate the Abyss from which they have escaped, and they thank God that they are not as other men.&nbsp; And lo! down upon them comes Johnny Upright and the monster city at his heels.&nbsp; Tenements spring up like magic, gardens are built upon, villas are divided and subdivided into many dwellings, and the black night of London settles down in a greasy pall.</p></div> </div>
