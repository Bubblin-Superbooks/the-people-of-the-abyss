<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I often used to meet, when I was curate at Kensington, families drifting into London along the Hammersmith Road.&nbsp; One day there came along a labourer and his wife, his son and two daughters.&nbsp; Their family had lived for a long time on an estate in the country, and managed, with the help of the common-land and their labour, to get on.&nbsp; But the time came when the common was encroached upon, and their labour was not needed on the estate, and they were quietly turned out of their cottage.&nbsp; Where should they go?&nbsp; Of course to London, where work was thought to be plentiful.&nbsp; They had a little savings, and they thought they could get two decent rooms to live in.&nbsp; But the inexorable land question met them in London.&nbsp; They tried the decent courts for lodgings, and found that two rooms would cost ten shillings a week.</p></div> </div>
