<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We had long since left Mile End Road, and after traversing a gloomy maze of narrow, winding streets, we came to Poplar Workhouse.&nbsp; On a low stone wall we spread our handkerchiefs, and each in his handkerchief put all his worldly possessions, with the exception of the &ldquo;bit o&rsquo; baccy&rdquo; down his sock.&nbsp; And then, as the last light was fading from the drab-coloured sky, the wind blowing cheerless and cold, we stood, with our pitiful little bundles in our hands, a forlorn group at the workhouse door.</p><p>Three working girls came along, and one looked pityingly at me; as she passed I followed her with my eyes, and she still looked pityingly back at me.&nbsp; The old men she did not notice.&nbsp; Dear Christ, she pitied me, young and vigorous and strong, but she had no pity for the two old men who stood by my side!&nbsp;</p></div> </div>
