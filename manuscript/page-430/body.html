<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With life so precarious, and opportunity for the happiness of life so remote, it is inevitable that life shall be cheap and suicide common.&nbsp; So common is it, that one cannot pick up a daily paper without running across it; while an attempt-at-suicide case in a police court excites no more interest than an ordinary &ldquo;drunk,&rdquo; and is handled with the same rapidity and unconcern.</p><p>I remember such a case in the Thames Police Court.&nbsp; I pride myself that I have good eyes and ears, and a fair working knowledge of men and things; but I confess, as I stood in that court-room, that I was half bewildered by the amazing despatch with which drunks, disorderlies, vagrants, brawlers, wife-beaters, thieves, fences, gamblers, and women of the street went through the machine of justice.</p></div> </div>
