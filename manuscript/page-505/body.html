<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Every twenty-four hours in the year Dr. Barnardo snatches nine waifs from the streets; so the enormous field he has to work in may be comprehended.&nbsp; The people who try to help have something to learn from him.&nbsp; He does not play with palliatives.&nbsp; He traces social viciousness and misery to their sources.&nbsp; He removes the progeny of the gutter-folk from their pestilential environment, and gives them a healthy, wholesome environment in which to be pressed and prodded and moulded into men.</p><p>When the people who try to help cease their playing and dabbling with day nurseries and Japanese art exhibits and go back and learn their West End and the sociology of Christ, they will be in better shape to buckle down to the work they ought to be doing in the world.</p></div> </div>
