<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Any one who knows anything about children knows how easily a child&rsquo;s digestion is upset by a fit of crying, or trouble and mental distress of any kind.&nbsp; A child who has been crying all day long, and perhaps half the night, in a lonely dim-lit cell, and is preyed upon by terror, simply cannot eat food of this coarse, horrible kind.&nbsp; In the case of the little child to whom Warder Martin gave the biscuits, the child was crying with hunger on Tuesday morning, and utterly unable to eat the bread and water served to it for its breakfast.&nbsp; Martin went out after the breakfasts had been served and bought the few sweet biscuits for the child rather than see it starving.&nbsp; It was a beautiful action on his part, and was so recognised by the child, who, utterly unconscious of the regulations of the Prison Board, told one of the senior wardens how kind this junior warden had been to him.&nbsp; The result was, of course, a report and a dismissal.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
