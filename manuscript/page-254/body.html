<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yew aw the enny, ennyseckle, Oi em ther bee, Oi&rsquo;d like ter sip ther enny from those red lips, yew see.&rdquo;</p><p>I sat on a bench on the Thames Embankment, looking across the illuminated water.&nbsp; It was approaching midnight, and before me poured the better class of merrymakers, shunning the more riotous streets and returning home.&nbsp; On the bench beside me sat two ragged creatures, a man and a woman, nodding and dozing.&nbsp; The woman sat with her arms clasped across the breast, holding tightly, her body in constant play&mdash;now dropping forward till it seemed its balance would be overcome and she would fall to the pavement; now inclining to the left, sideways, till her head rested on the man&rsquo;s shoulder; and now to the right, stretched and strained, till the pain of it awoke her and she sat bolt upright.</p></div> </div>
