<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And now I wish to criticise the powers that be.&nbsp; They are the powers, therefore they may decree whatever they please; so I make bold only to criticise the ridiculousness of their decrees.&nbsp; All night long they make the homeless ones walk up and down.&nbsp; They drive them out of doors and passages, and lock them out of the parks.&nbsp; The evident intention of all this is to deprive them of sleep.&nbsp; Well and good, the powers have the power to deprive them of sleep, or of anything else for that matter; but why under the sun do they open the gates of the parks at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning and let the homeless ones go inside and sleep?&nbsp; If it is their intention to deprive them of sleep, why do they let them sleep after five in the morning?&nbsp; And if it is not their intention to deprive them of sleep, why don&rsquo;t they let them sleep earlier in the night?</p></div> </div>
