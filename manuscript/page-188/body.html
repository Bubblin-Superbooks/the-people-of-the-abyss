<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; This was a long, narrow room, traversed by two low iron rails.&nbsp; Between these rails were stretched, not hammocks, but pieces of canvas, six feet long and less than two feet wide.&nbsp; These were the beds, and they were six inches apart and about eight inches above the floor.&nbsp; The chief difficulty was that the head was somewhat higher than the feet, which caused the body constantly to slip down.&nbsp; Being slung to the same rails, when one man moved, no matter how slightly, the rest were set rocking; and whenever I dozed somebody was sure to struggle back to the position from which he had slipped, and arouse me again.</p><p>Many hours passed before I won to sleep.&nbsp; It was only seven in the evening, and the voices of children, in shrill outcry, playing in the street, continued till nearly midnight.</p></div> </div>
