<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The true British merchant seaman has passed away.&nbsp; The merchant service is no longer a recruiting ground for such sea dogs as fought with Nelson at Trafalgar and the Nile.&nbsp; Foreigners largely man the merchant ships, though Englishmen still continue to officer them and to prefer foreigners for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; In South Africa the colonial teaches the islander how to shoot, and the officers muddle and blunder; while at home the street people play hysterically at mafficking, and the War Office lowers the stature for enlistment.</p><p>It could not be otherwise.&nbsp; The most complacent Britisher cannot hope to draw off the life-blood, and underfeed, and keep it up forever.&nbsp; The average Mrs. Thomas Mugridge has been driven into the city, and she is not breeding very much of anything save an anaemic and sickly progeny which cannot find enough to eat.</p></div> </div>
