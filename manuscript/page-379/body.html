<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Religion has virtually passed it by, and a gross and stupid materialism reigns, fatal alike to the things of the spirit and the finer instincts of life.</p><p>It used to be the proud boast that every Englishman&rsquo;s home was his castle.&nbsp; But to-day it is an anachronism.&nbsp; The Ghetto folk have no homes.&nbsp; They do not know the significance and the sacredness of home life.&nbsp; Even the municipal dwellings, where live the better-class workers, are overcrowded barracks.&nbsp; They have no home life.&nbsp; The very language proves it.&nbsp; The father returning from work asks his child in the street where her mother is; and back the answer comes, &ldquo;In the buildings.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
