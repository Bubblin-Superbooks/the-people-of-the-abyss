<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As a vagrant in the &ldquo;Hobo&rdquo; of a California jail, I have been served better food and drink than the London workman receives in his coffee-houses; while as an American labourer I have eaten a breakfast for twelvepence such as the British labourer would not dream of eating.&nbsp; Of course, he will pay only three or four pence for his; which is, however, as much as I paid, for I would be earning six shillings to his two or two and a half.&nbsp; On the other hand, though, and in return, I would turn out an amount of work in the course of the day that would put to shame the amount he turned out.&nbsp; So there are two sides to it.&nbsp; The man with the high standard of living will always do more work and better than the man with the low standard of living.</p></div> </div>
