<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Another phrase gone glimmering, shorn of romance and tradition and all that goes to make phrases worth keeping!&nbsp; For me, henceforth, &ldquo;coffee-house&rdquo; will possess anything but an agreeable connotation.&nbsp; Over on the other side of the world, the mere mention of the word was sufficient to conjure up whole crowds of its historic frequenters, and to send trooping through my imagination endless groups of wits and dandies, pamphleteers and bravos, and bohemians of Grub Street.</p><p>But here, on this side of the world, alas and alack, the very name is a misnomer.&nbsp; Coffee-house: a place where people drink coffee.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; You cannot obtain coffee in such a place for love or money.&nbsp; True, you may call for coffee, and you will have brought you something in a cup purporting to be coffee, and you will taste it and be disillusioned, for coffee it certainly is not.</p></div> </div>
