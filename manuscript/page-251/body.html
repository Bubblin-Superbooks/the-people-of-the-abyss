<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I drift with the crowd out of the square into a tangle of narrow streets, where the public-houses are a-roar with drunkenness, men, women, and children mixed together in colossal debauch.&nbsp; And on every side is rising the favourite song of the Coronation:-</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! on Coronation Day, on Coronation Day, We&rsquo;ll have a spree, a jubilee, and shout, Hip, hip, hooray, For we&rsquo;ll all be marry, drinking whisky, wine, and sherry, We&rsquo;ll all be merry on Coronation Day.&rdquo;</p><p>The rain is pouring down.&nbsp; Up the street come troops of the auxiliaries, black Africans and yellow Asiatics, beturbaned and befezed, and coolies swinging along with machine guns and mountain batteries on their heads, and the bare feet of all, in quick rhythm, going slish, slish, slish through the pavement mud.</p></div> </div>
