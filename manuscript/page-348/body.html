<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Last year, Mr. Thomas Holmes, a police-court missionary of note, after writing about the condition of the women workers, received the following letter, dated April 18, 1901:-</p><p>Sir,&mdash;Pardon the liberty I am taking, but, having read what you said about poor women working fourteen hours a day for ten shillings per week, I beg to state my case.&nbsp; I am a tie-maker, who, after working all the week, cannot earn more than five shillings, and I have a poor afflicted husband to keep who hasn&rsquo;t earned a penny for more than ten years.</p><p>Imagine a woman, capable of writing such a clear, sensible, grammatical letter, supporting her husband and self on five shillings per week!&nbsp; Mr. Holmes visited her.&nbsp; He had to squeeze to get into the room.</p></div> </div>
