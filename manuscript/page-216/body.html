<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now, about the Salvation Army in general I know nothing, and whatever criticism I shall make here is of that particular portion of the Salvation Army which does business on Blackfriars Road near the Surrey Theatre.&nbsp; In the first place, this forcing of men who have been up all night to stand on their feet for hours longer, is as cruel as it is needless.&nbsp; We were weak, famished, and exhausted from our night&rsquo;s hardship and lack of sleep, and yet there we stood, and stood, and stood, without rhyme or reason.</p><p>Sailors were very plentiful in this crowd.&nbsp; It seemed to me that one man in four was looking for a ship, and I found at least a dozen of them to be American sailors.&nbsp; In accounting for their being &ldquo;on the beach,&rdquo; I received the same story from each and all, and from my knowledge of sea affairs this story rang true.</p></div> </div>
