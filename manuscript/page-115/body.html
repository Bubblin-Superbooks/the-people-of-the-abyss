<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For the benefit of gently nurtured and innocent folk, let me explain what a ward is.&nbsp; It is a building where the homeless, bedless, penniless man, if he be lucky, may casually rest his weary bones, and then work like a navvy next day to pay for it.</p><p>My second attempt to break into the casual ward began more auspiciously.&nbsp; I started in the middle of the afternoon, accompanied by the burning young socialist and another friend, and all I had in my pocket was thru&rsquo;pence.&nbsp; They piloted me to the Whitechapel Workhouse, at which I peered from around a friendly corner.&nbsp; It was a few minutes past five in the afternoon but already a long and melancholy line was formed, which strung out around the corner of the building and out of sight.</p></div> </div>
