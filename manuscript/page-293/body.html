<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was Saturday afternoon, and we knew quitting time would come early; so we applied ourselves earnestly to the task, desiring to learn if we could at least make our salt.&nbsp; It was simple work, woman&rsquo;s work, in fact, and not man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We sat on the edge of the bin, between the standing hops, while a pole-puller supplied us with great fragrant branches.&nbsp; In an hour&rsquo;s time we became as expert as it is possible to become.&nbsp; As soon as the fingers became accustomed automatically to differentiate between hops and leaves and to strip half-a-dozen blossoms at a time there was no more to learn.</p><p>We worked nimbly, and as fast as the women themselves, though their bins filled more rapidly because of their swarming children, each of which picked with two hands almost as fast as we picked.</p></div> </div>
