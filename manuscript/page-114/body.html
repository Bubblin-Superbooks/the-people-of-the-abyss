<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have found that it is not easy to get into the casual ward of the workhouse.&nbsp; I have made two attempts now, and I shall shortly make a third.&nbsp; The first time I started out at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening with four shillings in my pocket.&nbsp; Herein I committed two errors.&nbsp; In the first place, the applicant for admission to the casual ward must be destitute, and as he is subjected to a rigorous search, he must really be destitute; and fourpence, much less four shillings, is sufficient affluence to disqualify him.&nbsp; In the second place, I made the mistake of tardiness.&nbsp; Seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening is too late in the day for a pauper to get a pauper&rsquo;s bed.</p></div> </div>
