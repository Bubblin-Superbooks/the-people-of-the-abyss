<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is a matter of sober calculation, here in England, that it is softer to work for twenty shillings a week, and have regular food, and a bed at night, than it is to walk the streets.&nbsp; The man who walks the streets suffers more, and works harder, for far less return.&nbsp; I have depicted the nights they spend, and how, driven in by physical exhaustion, they go to the casual ward for a &ldquo;rest up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor is the casual ward a soft snap.&nbsp; To pick four pounds of oakum, break twelve hundredweight of stones, or perform the most revolting tasks, in return for the miserable food and shelter they receive, is an unqualified extravagance on the part of the men who are guilty of it.&nbsp; On the part of the authorities it is sheer robbery.&nbsp; They give the men far less for their labour than do the capitalistic employers.</p></div> </div>
