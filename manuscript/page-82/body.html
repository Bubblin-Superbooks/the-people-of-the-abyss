<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My first impression of East London was naturally a general one.&nbsp; Later the details began to appear, and here and there in the chaos of misery I found little spots where a fair measure of happiness reigned&mdash;sometimes whole rows of houses in little out-of-the-way streets, where artisans dwell and where a rude sort of family life obtains.&nbsp; In the evenings the men can be seen at the doors, pipes in their mouths and children on their knees, wives gossiping, and laughter and fun going on.&nbsp; The content of these people is manifestly great, for, relative to the wretchedness that encompasses them, they are well off.</p><p>But at the best, it is a dull, animal happiness, the content of the full belly.&nbsp; The dominant note of their lives is materialistic.&nbsp; They are stupid and heavy, without imagination.</p></div> </div>
