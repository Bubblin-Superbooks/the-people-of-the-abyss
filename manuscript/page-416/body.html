<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the second ewe, before the Luton Guardians a few days ago, an old woman of seventy-two appeared, asking for relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was a straw-hat maker, but had been compelled to give up the work owing to the price she obtained for them&mdash;namely, 2.25d. each.&nbsp; For that price she had to provide plait trimmings and make and finish the hats.&rdquo;</p><p>Yet this mother and her three children we are considering have done no wrong that they should be so punished.&nbsp; They have not sinned.&nbsp; The thing happened, that is all; the husband, father and bread-winner, was struck down.&nbsp; There is no guarding against it.&nbsp; It is fortuitous.&nbsp; A family stands so many chances of escaping the bottom of the Abyss, and so many chances of falling plump down to it.</p></div> </div>
