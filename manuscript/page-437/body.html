<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Such verdicts are crimes against truth.&nbsp; The Law is a lie, and through it men lie most shamelessly.&nbsp; For instance, a disgraced woman, forsaken and spat upon by kith and kin, doses herself and her baby with laudanum.&nbsp; The baby dies; but she pulls through after a few weeks in hospital, is charged with murder, convicted, and sentenced to ten years&rsquo; penal servitude.&nbsp; Recovering, the Law holds her responsible for her actions; yet, had she died, the same Law would have rendered a verdict of temporary insanity.</p><p>Now, considering the case of Ellen Hughes Hunt, it is as fair and logical to say that her husband was suffering from temporary insanity when he went into the Islington Workhouse, as it is to say that she was suffering from temporary insanity when she went into the Regent&rsquo;s Canal.</p></div> </div>
