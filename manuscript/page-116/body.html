<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a most woeful picture, men and women waiting in the cold grey end of the day for a pauper&rsquo;s shelter from the night, and I confess it almost unnerved me.&nbsp; Like the boy before the dentist&rsquo;s door, I suddenly discovered a multitude of reasons for being elsewhere.&nbsp; Some hints of the struggle going on within must have shown in my face, for one of my companions said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t funk; you can do it.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course I could do it, but I became aware that even thru&rsquo;pence in my pocket was too lordly a treasure for such a throng; and, in order that all invidious distinctions might be removed, I emptied out the coppers.&nbsp; Then I bade good-bye to my friends, and with my heart going pit-a-pat, slouched down the street and took my place at the end of the line.</p></div> </div>
