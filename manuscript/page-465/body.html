<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; It was a menagerie of garmented bipeds that looked something like humans and more like beasts, and to complete the picture, brass-buttoned keepers kept order among them when they snarled too fiercely.</p><p>I was glad the keepers were there, for I did not have on my &ldquo;seafaring&rdquo; clothes, and I was what is called a &ldquo;mark&rdquo; for the creatures of prey that prowled up and down.&nbsp; At times, between keepers, these males looked at me sharply, hungrily, gutter-wolves that they were, and I was afraid of their hands, of their naked hands, as one may be afraid of the paws of a gorilla.&nbsp; They reminded me of gorillas.&nbsp; Their bodies were small, ill-shaped, and squat.&nbsp; There were no swelling muscles, no abundant thews and wide-spreading shoulders.&nbsp; They exhibited, rather, an elemental economy of nature, such as the cave-men must have exhibited.</p></div> </div>
