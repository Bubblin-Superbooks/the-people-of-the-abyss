<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Old age, of course, makes pauperism.&nbsp; And then there is the accident, the thing happening, the death or disablement of the husband, father, and bread-winner.&nbsp; Here is a man, with a wife and three children, living on the ticklish security of twenty shillings per week&mdash;and there are hundreds of thousands of such families in London.&nbsp; Perforce, to even half exist, they must live up to the last penny of it, so that a week&rsquo;s wages (one pound) is all that stands between this family and pauperism or starvation.&nbsp; The thing happens, the father is struck down, and what then?&nbsp; A mother with three children can do little or nothing.&nbsp; Either she must hand her children over to society as juvenile paupers, in order to be free to do something adequate for herself, or she must go to the sweat-shops for work which she can perform in the vile den possible to her reduced income.</p></div> </div>
