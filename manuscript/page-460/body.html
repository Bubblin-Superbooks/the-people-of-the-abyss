<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>He tells of a member of his congregation who let a basement room to a married couple.&nbsp; &ldquo;They said they had two children; when they got possession it turned out that they had four.&nbsp; After a while a fifth appeared, and the landlord gave them notice to quit.&nbsp; They paid no attention to it.&nbsp; Then the sanitary inspector who has to wink at the law so often, came in and threatened my friend with legal proceedings.&nbsp; He pleaded that he could not get them out.&nbsp; They pleaded that nobody would have them with so many children at a rental within their means, which is one of the commonest complaints of the poor, by-the-bye.&nbsp; What was to be done?&nbsp; The landlord was between two millstones.&nbsp; Finally he applied to the magistrate, who sent up an officer to inquire into the case.&nbsp; Since that time about twenty days have elapsed, and nothing has yet been done.&nbsp; Is this a singular case?&nbsp; By no means; it is quite common.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
