<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Where home is a hovel, and dull we grovel, Forgetting the world is fair.&rdquo;</p><p>There is one beautiful sight in the East End, and only one, and it is the children dancing in the street when the organ-grinder goes his round.&nbsp; It is fascinating to watch them, the new-born, the next generation, swaying and stepping, with pretty little mimicries and graceful inventions all their own, with muscles that move swiftly and easily, and bodies that leap airily, weaving rhythms never taught in dancing school.</p><p>I have talked with these children, here, there, and everywhere, and they struck me as being bright as other children, and in many ways even brighter.&nbsp; They have most active little imaginations.&nbsp; Their capacity for projecting themselves into the realm of romance and fantasy is remarkable.&nbsp; A joyous life is romping in their blood.</p></div> </div>
