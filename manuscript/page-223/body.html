<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For an hour we stood quietly in this packed courtyard.&nbsp; Then the men began to grow restless.&nbsp; There was pushing and shoving forward, and a mild hubbub of voices.&nbsp; Nothing rough, however, nor violent; merely the restlessness of weary and hungry men.&nbsp; At this juncture forth came the adjutant.&nbsp; I did not like him.&nbsp; His eyes were not good.&nbsp; There was nothing of the lowly Galilean about him, but a great deal of the centurion who said: &ldquo;For I am a man in authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
