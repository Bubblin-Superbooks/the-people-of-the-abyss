<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Carter was hard put to keep the pace at which we walked (he told me that he had eaten nothing that day), but the Carpenter, lean and hungry, his grey and ragged overcoat flapping mournfully in the breeze, swung on in a long and tireless stride which reminded me strongly of the plains wolf or coyote.&nbsp; Both kept their eyes upon the pavement as they walked and talked, and every now and then one or the other would stoop and pick something up, never missing the stride the while.&nbsp; I thought it was cigar and cigarette stumps they were collecting, and for some time took no notice.&nbsp; Then I did notice.</p><p>From the slimy, spittle-drenched, sidewalk, they were picking up bits of orange peel, apple skin, and grape stems, and, they were eating them.&nbsp; The pits of greengage plums they cracked between their teeth for the kernels inside.</p></div> </div>
