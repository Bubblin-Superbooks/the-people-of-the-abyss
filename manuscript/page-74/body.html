<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; An unconscious hedonist, utterly unmoral and materialistic, he sought the greatest possible happiness for himself, and found it in drink.</p><p>A young sot; a premature wreck; physical inability to do a stoker&rsquo;s work; the gutter or the workhouse; and the end&mdash;he saw it all as clearly as I, but it held no terrors for him.&nbsp; From the moment of his birth, all the forces of his environment had tended to harden him, and he viewed his wretched, inevitable future with a callousness and unconcern I could not shake.</p><p>And yet he was not a bad man.&nbsp; He was not inherently vicious and brutal.&nbsp; He had normal mentality, and a more than average physique.&nbsp; His eyes were blue and round, shaded by long lashes, and wide apart.&nbsp; And there was a laugh in them, and a fund of humour behind.</p></div> </div>
