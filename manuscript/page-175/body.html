<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I noticed another man and his old woman join the line, both of them past fifty.&nbsp; The woman, because she was a woman, was admitted into the spike; but he was too late, and, separated from his mate, was turned away to tramp the streets all night.</p><p>The street on which we stood, from wall to wall, was barely twenty feet wide.&nbsp; The sidewalks were three feet wide.&nbsp; It was a residence street.&nbsp; At least workmen and their families existed in some sort of fashion in the houses across from us.&nbsp; And each day and every day, from one in the afternoon till six, our ragged spike line is the principal feature of the view commanded by their front doors and windows.&nbsp; One workman sat in his door directly opposite us, taking his rest and a breath of air after the toil of the day.&nbsp; His wife came to chat with him.</p></div> </div>
