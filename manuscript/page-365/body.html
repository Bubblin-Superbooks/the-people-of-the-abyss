<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Here is a typical example of a room on the more respectable two-relay system.&nbsp; It is occupied in the daytime by a young woman employed all night in a hotel.&nbsp; At seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening she vacates the room, and a bricklayer&rsquo;s labourer comes in.&nbsp; At seven in the morning he vacates, and goes to his work, at which time she returns from hers.</p><p>The Rev. W. N. Davies, rector of Spitalfields, took a census of some of the alleys in his parish.&nbsp; He says:-</p><p>In one alley there are ten houses&mdash;fifty-one rooms, nearly all about 8 feet by 9 feet&mdash;and 254 people.&nbsp; In six instances only do 2 people occupy one room; and in others the number varied from 3 to 9.</p></div> </div>
