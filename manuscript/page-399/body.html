<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This must not be considered a sweeping condemnation of the big private and municipal lodging-houses and working-men&rsquo;s homes.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; They have remedied many of the atrocities attendant upon the irresponsible small doss-houses, and they give the workman more for his money than he ever received before; but that does not make them as habitable or wholesome as the dwelling-place of a man should be who does his work in the world.</p><p>The little private doss-houses, as a rule, are unmitigated horrors.&nbsp; I have slept in them, and I know; but let me pass them by and confine myself to the bigger and better ones.&nbsp; Not far from Middlesex Street, Whitechapel, I entered such a house, a place inhabited almost entirely by working men.&nbsp; The entrance was by way of a flight of steps descending from the sidewalk to what was properly the cellar of the building.</p></div> </div>
