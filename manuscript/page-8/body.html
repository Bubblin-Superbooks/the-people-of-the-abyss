<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The chief priests and rulers cry:-</p><p>&ldquo;O Lord and Master, not ours the guilt, We build but as our fathers built; Behold thine images how they stand Sovereign and sole through all our land.</p><p>&ldquo;Our task is hard&mdash;with sword and flame, To hold thine earth forever the same, And with sharp crooks of steel to keep, Still as thou leftest them, thy sheep.&rdquo;</p><p>Then Christ sought out an artisan, A low-browed, stunted, haggard man, And a motherless girl whose fingers thin Crushed from her faintly want and sin.</p><p>These set he in the midst of them, And as they drew back their garment hem For fear of defilement, &ldquo;Lo, here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;The images ye have made of me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
