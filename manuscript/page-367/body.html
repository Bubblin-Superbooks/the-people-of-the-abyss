C. Steadman, in the House of Commons, in a speech concerning his constituency in Stepney, related the following:-</p><p>This morning, not a hundred yards from where I am myself living, a widow stopped me.&nbsp; She has six children to support, and the rent of her house was fourteen shillings per week.&nbsp; She gets her living by letting the house to lodgers and doing a day&rsquo;s washing or charring.</p></div> </div>
