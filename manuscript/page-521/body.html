<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have a vague remembrance &nbsp;&nbsp; Of a story that is told In some ancient Spanish legend &nbsp;&nbsp; Or chronicle of old.</p><p>It was when brave King Sanche &nbsp;&nbsp; Was before Zamora slain, And his great besieging army &nbsp;&nbsp; Lay encamped upon the plain.</p><p>Don Diego de Ordenez &nbsp;&nbsp; Sallied forth in front of all, And shouted loud his challenge &nbsp;&nbsp; To the warders on the wall.</p><p>All the people of Zamora, &nbsp;&nbsp; Both the born and the unborn, As traitors did he challenge &nbsp;&nbsp; With taunting words of scorn.</p><p>The living in their houses, &nbsp;&nbsp; And in their graves the dead, And the waters in their rivers, &nbsp;&nbsp; And their wine, and oil, and bread.</p></div> </div>
