<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Early in the morning, along the streets frequented by workmen on the way to work, many women sit on the sidewalk with sacks of bread beside them.&nbsp; No end of workmen purchase these, and eat them as they walk along.&nbsp; They do not even wash the dry bread down with the tea to be obtained for a penny in the coffee-houses.&nbsp; It is incontestable that a man is not fit to begin his day&rsquo;s work on a meal like that; and it is equally incontestable that the loss will fall upon his employer and upon the nation.&nbsp; For some time, now, statesmen have been crying, &ldquo;Wake up, England!&rdquo;&nbsp; It would show more hard-headed common sense if they changed the tune to &ldquo;Feed up, England!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
