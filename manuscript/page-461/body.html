<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Last week the police raided a disorderly house.&nbsp; In one room were found two young children.&nbsp; They were arrested and charged with being inmates the same as the women had been.&nbsp; Their father appeared at the trial.&nbsp; He stated that himself and wife and two older children, besides the two in the dock, occupied that room; he stated also that he occupied it because he could get no other room for the half-crown a week he paid for it.&nbsp; The magistrate discharged the two juvenile offenders and warned the father that he was bringing his children up unhealthily.</p><p>But there is no need further to multiply instances.&nbsp; In London the slaughter of the innocents goes on on a scale more stupendous than any before in the history of the world.</p></div> </div>
