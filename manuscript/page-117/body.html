<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Woeful it looked, this line of poor folk tottering on the steep pitch to death; how woeful it was I did not dream.</p><p>Next to me stood a short, stout man.&nbsp; Hale and hearty, though aged, strong-featured, with the tough and leathery skin produced by long years of sunbeat and weatherbeat, his was the unmistakable sea face and eyes; and at once there came to me a bit of Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Galley Slave&rdquo;:-</p><p>&ldquo;By the brand upon my shoulder, by the gall of clinging steel; By the welt the whips have left me, by the scars that never heal; By eyes grown old with staring through the sun-wash on the brine, I am paid in full for service . . . &rdquo;</p></div> </div>
