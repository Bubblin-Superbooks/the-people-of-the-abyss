<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Grass only grows here, and it is surrounded by a sharp-spiked iron fencing, as are all the parks of London Town, so that homeless men and women may not come in at night and sleep upon it.</p><p>As we entered the garden, an old woman, between fifty and sixty, passed us, striding with sturdy intention if somewhat rickety action, with two bulky bundles, covered with sacking, slung fore and aft upon her.&nbsp; She was a woman tramp, a houseless soul, too independent to drag her failing carcass through the workhouse door.&nbsp; Like the snail, she carried her home with her.&nbsp; In the two sacking-covered bundles were her household goods, her wardrobe, linen, and dear feminine possessions.</p></div> </div>
