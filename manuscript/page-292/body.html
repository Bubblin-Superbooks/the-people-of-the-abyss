<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Can yer give us a job, governor?&rdquo; Bert asked the bailiff, a kindly faced and elderly man who was very busy.</p><p>His &ldquo;No&rdquo; was decisively uttered; but Bert clung on and followed him about, and I followed after, pretty well all over the field.&nbsp; Whether our persistency struck the bailiff as anxiety to work, or whether he was affected by our hard-luck appearance and tale, neither Bert nor I succeeded in making out; but in the end he softened his heart and found us the one unoccupied bin in the place&mdash;a bin deserted by two other men, from what I could learn, because of inability to make living wages.</p><p>&ldquo;No bad conduct, mind ye,&rdquo; warned the bailiff, as he left us at work in the midst of the women.</p></div> </div>
