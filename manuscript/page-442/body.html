<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Insecurity of food and shelter, by the way, is a great cause of insanity among the living.&nbsp; Costermongers, hawkers, and pedlars, a class of workers who live from hand to mouth more than those of any other class, form the highest percentage of those in the lunatic asylums.&nbsp; Among the males each year, 26.9 per 10,000 go insane, and among the women, 36.9.&nbsp; On the other hand, of soldiers, who are at least sure of food and shelter, 13 per 10,000 go insane; and of farmers and graziers, only 5.1.&nbsp; So a coster is twice as likely to lose his reason as a soldier, and five times as likely as a farmer.</p><p>Misfortune and misery are very potent in turning people&rsquo;s heads, and drive one person to the lunatic asylum, and another to the morgue or the gallows.</p></div> </div>
