<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I walked up Mile End Road between the Carter and the Carpenter.&nbsp; Mile End Road is a wide thoroughfare, cutting the heart of East London, and there were tens of thousands of people abroad on it.&nbsp; I tell you this so that you may fully appreciate what I shall describe in the next paragraph.&nbsp; As I say, we walked along, and when they grew bitter and cursed the land, I cursed with them, cursed as an American waif would curse, stranded in a strange and terrible land.&nbsp; And, as I tried to lead them to believe, and succeeded in making them believe, they took me for a &ldquo;seafaring man,&rdquo; who had spent his money in riotous living, lost his clothes (no unusual occurrence with seafaring men ashore), and was temporarily broke while looking for a ship.&nbsp; This accounted for my ignorance of English ways in general and casual wards in particular, and my curiosity concerning the same.</p></div> </div>
