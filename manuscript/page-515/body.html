<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If the struggle for commercial supremacy is profitable, continue it.&nbsp; If it is not, if it hurts the worker and makes his lot worse than the lot of a savage, then fling foreign markets and industrial empire overboard.&nbsp; For it is a patent fact that if 40,000,000 people, aided by Civilisation, possess a greater individual producing power than the Innuit, then those 40,000,000 people should enjoy more creature comforts and heart&rsquo;s delights than the Innuits enjoy.</p><p>If the 400,000 English gentlemen, &ldquo;of no occupation,&rdquo; according to their own statement in the Census of 1881, are unprofitable, do away with them.&nbsp; Set them to work ploughing game preserves and planting potatoes.&nbsp; If they are profitable, continue them by all means, but let it be seen to that the average Englishman shares somewhat in the profits they produce by working at no occupation.</p></div> </div>
